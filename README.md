Collaboration: Figma enables real-time collaboration, allowing multiple team members to work on a design simultaneously. Changes made by one user are instantly visible to others, fostering a collaborative design process.

Cloud-Based: Figma operates in the cloud, meaning that designs are stored online rather than on local machines. This facilitates easy sharing, accessibility from different devices, and automatic version control.

Prototyping: Users can create interactive prototypes to simulate the user experience and test the functionality of their designs. This helps in visualizing how the final product will behave.

Vector Editing: Figma provides powerful vector editing tools for creating and manipulating design elements. This makes it well-suited for creating scalable graphics.
Components and Styles: Figma supports the use of design components and styles, allowing designers to create consistent and reusable elements throughout their projects. Changes made to a component or style reflect across all instances, ensuring design consistency.

Plugins: Figma supports a variety of plugins that extend its functionality. Users can install plugins to streamline their workflow and add additional features to the tool.
